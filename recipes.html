            <li>penneboleognese.jpg </li>
            <li>My best friend was trying out fast, nutritious, and delicious recipes that could fit his on the go lifestyle at college. He has always been a foody and was tired of eating the same thing every day at the dining hall. He figured out the perfect recipe with simple ingredients and makes it taste like restaurant quality! Note, the pasta is best a tad undercooked, or aldente.</li>
            <li><h2>Recipe Ingredients</h2></li>
            <li>Any type of uncooked pasta you prefer, but I recommend penne or rigatoni.</li>
            <li>Rag√∫'s traditional sauce</li>
            <li>Olive Oil</li>
            <li>ground beef, or any ground protein of your choice</li>
            <li><h2>Recipe Steps</h2></li>
            <li>Step 1: Start boiling a large pot of water over the stove, and let that sit while you prepare the rest.</li>
            <li>Step 2: Take a pan and put olive oil on the bottom, set your stove to medium heat.</li>
            <li>Step 3: Put your ground beef in the pan, and lightly stir it until the meat is cooked.</li>
            <li>Step 4: Pour in all of your sauce into the pan and mix it in with the meat.</li>
            <li>Step 5: Stir it lightly, but then let it sit so the meat can absorb the sauce.</li>
            <li>Step 6: By now, your water should be boiling, so throw in your pasta and wait about 10 minutes for that to cook.</li>
            <li>Step 7: Once the pasta is ready, dump it into the pan with your meat and sauce, and stir it together.</li>
            <li>Step 8: Serve it in a bowl and let it cool.</li>
            <li>Step 9: Enjoy!</li>

            <li><h3>Salmon Bowls</h3></li>
            <li>origin: California</li>
            <li>Source: My favorite meal to cook for dinner with my family.</li>
            <li>Category: Main Dish</li>
            <li><img src="images/salmonbowls.jpg" width ="200" alt = "Salmon and Rice bowl with veggies and teryaki sauce on top."> </li>
            <li>salmonbowls.jpg </li>
            <li>My mom always used to make my sister and I salmon teryaki with rice, so as I got older and started to cook for myself, I wanted to create my take on it. I love poke bowls, so I decided to use that as inspiration, but use cooked salmon instead.</li>
            <li><h3>Recipe Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>white rice that you are able to cook with your means (rice cooker, microwave, etc)</li>
                    <li>Raw filet of salmon</li>
                    <li>Olive Oil</li>
                    <li>vegetables of your choice, I like cucumbers and avacados</li>
                    <li>Eel Sauce, Teryaki sauce, or soy sauce</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Recipe Steps</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Step 1: Cook your rice, follow the directions on the package you have.</li>
                    <li>Step 2: Take a pan and put olive oil on the bottom.</li>
                    <li>Step 3: Cut your raw salmon into cube size chunks.</li>
                    <li>Step 4: Put your salmon in the pan, and wait about 5 minutes, then flip it over and do the same. You'll know it's done when the salmon is light pink all the way through and lightly browned on both the top and bottom.</li>
                    <li>Step 5: Turn off the pan and let the salmon cool.</li>
                    <li>Step 6: Cut up your vegetables of choice into small pieces.</li>
                    <li>Step 7: Put your rice into a bowl, and top it with your salmon cubes and veggies.</li>
                    <li>Step 8: Drizzle your sauce of choice over</li>
                    <li>Step 9: Enjoy!</li>
