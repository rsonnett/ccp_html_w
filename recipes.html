            <ul>
                <li>Ingredients:You are going to need any type of pasta shape you choose, I like penne, Rag√∫'s traditional sauce, and ground beef.</li>
                <li>Step 1: Start boiling a large pot of water over the stove.</li>
                <li>Step 2: Take a pan and put olive oil on the bottom.</li>
                <li>Step 3: Put your ground beef in the pan, and lightly stir it until the meat is cooked.</li>
                <li>Step 4: Pour in all of your sauce into the pan and mix it in with the meat.</li>
                <li>Step 5: Stir it lightly, but then let it sit so the meat can absorb the sauce.</li>
                <li>Step 6: By now, your water should be boiling, so throw in your pasta and wait about 10 minutes for that to cook.</li>
                <li>Step 7: Once the pasta is ready, dump it into the pan with your meat and sauce, and stir it together.</li>
                <li>Step 8: Serve it in a bowl and let it cool.</li>
                <li>Step 9: Enjoy!</li>

            <img src="images/salmonbowls.jpg" width ="200" alt = "Salmon and Rice bowl with veggies and teryaki sauce on top.">
            <ul>
                <li>Ingredients:You are going to need any type of rice you choose that is compatable with the means you have to make it (rice cooker, microwave, etc) You are also going to need a filet of raw salmon as well as any vegetables you like, I prefer cucumbers and seaweed salad. Lastly, you need a sauce like ponzu sauce, eel sauce, or teryaki sauce.</li>
                <li>Step 1: Cook your rice, follow the directions on the package you have.</li>
                <li>Step 2: Take a pan and put olive oil on the bottom.</li>
                <li>Step 3: Cut your raw salmon into cube size chunks.</li>
                <li>Step 4: Put your salmon in the pan, and wait about 5 minutes, then flip it over and do the same. You'll know it's done when the salmon is light pink all the way through and lightly browned on both the top and bottom.</li>
                <li>Step 5: Turn off the pan and let the salmon cool.</li>
                <li>Step 6: Cut up your vegetables of choice into small pieces.</li>
                <li>Step 7: Put your rice into a bowl, and top it with your salmon cubes and veggies.</li>
                <li>Step 8: Drizzle your sauce of choice over</li>
                <li>Step 9: Enjoy!</li>
