            <p>Ringo is a 1yr old Golden Retriever. He loves to play with his countless toys and bother his mom while she's working. He enjoys hiking and going to the beach, and pretending like he can actually catch the birds he chases.</p> 
            <P>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Ringo suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will jump on the bed and run around forcing you to throw the ball. Sometimes he even will bark at the television if theres an animal.</P>
